1. Enables complex model training

Machine Learning models require massive calculations (matrix multiplications, backpropagation, optimization).
Because of Moore’s Law:

1.Processors became faster

2.More operations per second became possible

3.Deep neural networks became practical

Without this hardware growth, models like deep learning and transformers would be impossible to train.
Then what changed? (Why they became practical)
1. More computing power (Moore’s Law + GPUs)

Powerful GPUs could perform millions of calculations in parallel.

This made it possible to:

Train very deep models

Do matrix operations fast

Run backpropagation efficiently

2. Big Data availability

Internet + digital storage created massive datasets:

Images (ImageNet)

Speech

Text

Deep networks need lots of data to learn patterns. Now they had it.

3. Better algorithms

New techniques solved old problems:

ReLU activation (fixed vanishing gradient)

Dropout (reduced overfitting)

Batch Normalization (faster training)

Adam optimizer (stable learning)

These made learning reliable.

4. Software frameworks

Libraries like:

TensorFlow

PyTorch

Keras

Made building deep networks easy and accessible.

So what was “happening” in simple words?

This was happening:

Computers became faster ✔️

Data became huge ✔️

Training methods improved ✔️

Errors decreased ✔️

Accuracy increased ✔️

Result:
👉 Deep neural networks started giving better results than traditional methods.

That is when they became PRACTICAL.

Real-world proof it became practical

After this shift, we saw:

Face recognition

Voice assistants

Google Translate

Self-driving vision

ChatGPT-like systems

All powered by deep neural networks.

Very simple understanding

Before:

Deep Neural Network = Good idea but too hard to use

Now:

Deep Neural Network = Powerful system that solves real problems
