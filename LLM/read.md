# LLM
Large language model.it basically created to understand human lanugage and their reuqest and give generate approriate response.it's get trained using the large amount of text data which is globally present.  
**let's talked about the relation of LLM to NN.**  
So,basically the large language model is lies beneath the neural networks because it uses alot of neural networks.  
# NN=it's a technology   
# LLM=it's a by product of that technologies.(which is generally used for understanding human language.)  
Mutiple input and multiple layer of mathematical operaion is going on in the nerual networks.
### Why does the LLM get's trained on so much huge amount of the text data?
*So that=:*
1.Understand human language very well 
2.Generate response
3.Answer question
4.Write code
5.Reason and solve problems
6.Translate language
7.
